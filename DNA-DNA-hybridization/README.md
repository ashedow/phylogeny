# DNA-DNA hybridization

## Definition

DNA-DNA hybridization is one method that provides more resolution than 16S rDNA sequencing, and the 70% criterion (22) has been a cornerstone for describing a bacterial species. In spite of these values, the method is not popular. Major disadvantages are the laborious nature of pairwise cross-hybridizations, the requirement for isotope use, and the impossibility of establishing a central database.
